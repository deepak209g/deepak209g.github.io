Making Presentations in the browser !!!

This project lets user to make presentations quite like powerpoint !!!
It has a slide and state based structure .
New slide can be dragged to the viewport .
Likewise new objects like bargraphs,images,videos,text etc can also be dragged in the active slide .
The top right section of the editor shows the list of all the components that are in the viewport.
Clicking on a particular name in the components list activates that component for editing its properties in the properties in The properties panel.
The names that the editor gives to your components are simply boaring . so double click to edit the names and make your project clean .

Now to save a state press 's' on the keyboard . it kind of freezes the state of different components .
To present press 'p' and to edit while in presenting mode press 'e'.
Press left and right arrow keys to transition between the states that you saved .
You can also save a project by using the save feature .
For video and images to work make separate folders 'videos' and 'images' and copy the required media into these for the presentation to work.
